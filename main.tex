% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

Underwater image formation is degraded by several factors, which causes the
    ocean to be a challenging environment for image processing. This paper aims
    to improve the visual servoing capability of an autonomous underwater
    vehicle, but using pre-processing algorithms to improve the image quality.
    We will use artificial fiducial markers to feed the visual controller.
    Therefore, three different methods for imaging enhancing are applied to the
    raw image aiming to increase the detection rate of the marker detector.
    Since the performance of the visual controller also depends on the
    detection time, this variable is also considered for the comparison.
    Finally, the algorithm which caused the best improvement in the marker
    detection is tested in a visual servoing mission.  The proposed methods
    have shown a significantly improvement in the marker detection rates at
    reasonable detection times for visual servoing of autonomous underwater
    vehicles.  In terms of visual servoing missions, this work shows that the
    proposed methods not only increase the controller frequency, but also makes
    visual servoing possible when water condition is not favorable and no
    marker can be detected without any pre-processing layer.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:int}

Underwater image analysis is useful for many applications, such as:
inspection of man-made structures, observation of marine fauna, monitoring,
seabed studies \cite{Aulinas2011}. Nonetheless, unlike normal images taken in
the air, physical characteristics of the water medium causes the underwater
images to be usually affected by limited range visibility, low contrast, non
uniform lighting, blurring, bright artifacts, and noise \cite{Yang2012}.

Light attenuation in the water is caused by light absorption and light
scattering. The former reduces the energy of light while the latter changes the
direction of the light. It directly affects light visibility, which can vary
from twenty up to five meters or even less \cite{Schettini2010}. Light
attenuation is not caused only by light propagation in the water medium, but
also due to dissolved particles and the floating particles in the water. These
interactions increase absorption and scattering effects.

Thus, several works have been published aiming to turn underwater images more
comprehensible to humans and even for machines, since it would permit the use
of standard image processing algorithms \cite{Schettini2010,
sankpal2016nonuniform, rodrigues2016enhancement, bazeille2006automatic,
arnold2005preprocessing, chiang2012underwater, iqbal2007underwater}.

One of the multiple interests in improve the underwater image quality is
feature extraction for visual servoing.  Visual servoing or vision-based
control is a control scheme that uses visual information to control the motion
of a robot. It is a multidisciplinary field that covers the knowledge of areas
such as kinematics, dynamics, image processing and control theory
\cite{Hutchinson1996}. Visual servoing mimics the way that humans use their
visual system to perform simple actions such as grabbing objects, positioning
the body to enter through a door or seating on a chair. On underwater robots,
visual servoing can be useful for performing tasks such as docking
\cite{Lee2003}, pipeline following \cite{Rives1997} and structure inspection
\cite{KRUPINSKI2015274}.  Moreover, underwater visual servoing has been used
for helping robot inspection and 3D reconstruction \cite{4302315}, assisting
ROV pilots \cite{4099090} and valves manipulation \cite{1282820}.

As visual servoing relies on the feature extraction, this work will take
advantage of the artificial fiducial markers. They are patterns that encode
unique ID and are especially designed to be easily detected by computer vision
systems. In Figure \ref{fig:marker_systems} some fiducial marker systems are
shown.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{./fig/marker_systems.png}
    \caption[Different marker systems]{Different marker systems \cite{Fiala2010}.}
	\label{fig:marker_systems}
\end{figure}

Given these characteristics, artificial fiducial markers have high detection
and low false-positive and false-negative rates. The use of fiducial markers is
suitable when object recognition or pose determination is needed with high
reliability and when the environment can be modified to affix them \cite{Fiala2010}. 

This paper quantitatively compares three different approaches for underwater
image enhancement, taking in account the marker detection rate and processing
time. It shows how the use of a image pre-processing layer can significantly
increase the detection rate of the marker detector, improving the performance
of a vehicle servoing in front of a marker.

The document is divided in Section \ref{sec:int}, which shows the state of art
and the paper goal, Section \ref{sec:exp_proced} shows the experimental
procedures and details the applied methods, Section \ref{sec:results} shows the
achieved results and discuss them and Section \ref{sec:concl} presents the
conclusion of this work. 


\section{Experimental Procedures} \label{sec:exp_proced}

In order to evaluate the different proposed methods, we used the FlatFish AUV (Figure
\ref{fig:flatfish_1}) \cite{flatfish_jan} to collect data to be analyzed
offline. FlatFish is an AUV developed by the Brazilian Institute of Robotics
and the Robotics Innovation Center as part of the FlatFish project, a project
founded by Shell which aims to develop an AUV for inspection assets of O\&G industry.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./fig/20160317-FF-Test-P1040442.jpg}
    \caption{FlatFish AUV.}
    \label{fig:flatfish_1}
\end{figure}

In the context of this work, it is important to mention that FlatFish is
equipped with four cameras Basler acA2040-gc25, able to capture up to 25 frames
per second with 2040 x 2040 resolution. The actuation system is composed of 6
thrusters disposed according to Figure \ref{fig:thrusters_configuration}. This
configuration controls 4 degrees of freedom, where roll and pitch are passively
controlled. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./fig/thrust_configuration.png}
    \caption{FlatFish thruster configuration \cite{saback2016}.}
    \label{fig:thrusters_configuration}
\end{figure}

The experiments were conducted in the Todos os Santos Bay, located in the city
of Salvador-BA, part of the Brazilian coast. A marker attached to an iron
pedestal was deployed in shallow waters, 20 meters deep. The vehicle was
placed in front of the marker, changing its marker-relative pose in terms of
position and orientation. At the end, one hour video containing 32613 was
acquired for posteriori analysis. Apriltags marker system was chosen due
to have presented the best performance among the open-source libraries
\cite{diego}.  Figure \ref{fig:apriltag_pedestal} shows the detection of
Apriltags in the ocean.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./fig/april_ocean3.png}
    \caption{Vehicle's camera detecting the Apriltag marker.}
    \label{fig:apriltags_ocean}
\end{figure}

The experiment consists in perform the pre-processing algorithms under the
whole video and comparing which one of the methods give the higher detection
rate. Since the detected frames will feed a visual controller, the time for
detection is also relevant factor. Therefore, we also will downscale images and
observe how this will affect the processing time. Acquired image resolution is
2040x2040 and in this work was scaled by the following factors: 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2
0.1 0.05.

\subsection{Methods}

The pre-processing algorithms in which the raw image is submitted is here described. 

The first approach, namely Method 1, converts the raw image to grayscale
before send it to the Apriltag detector.  Method 2 adds a stage of
normalization as a simple contrast stretching stage.  Method 3 is similar to
Method 2, however it uses contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
\cite{zuiderveld1994contrast} to improve the contrast of the grayscale image.
Method 4 is based on the method proposed by Iqbal \cite{iqbal2007underwater},
differences are that we use HSV instead of HSI and the contrast stretching was
also performed locally  using CLAHE, in opposite to the method proposed by
them.

Figure \ref{fig:methods_flow} shows a diagram with the pre-processing stages
applied to the raw image before it be processed by the marker detector, for each
method. 

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{./fig/processing_flow2.png}
    \caption{Data flow for each method.}
    \label{fig:methods_flow}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Visual Servoing}

On a different day, in order to evaluate the improvement of a visual servoing
task, the vehicle was submitted to a visual servoing under both conditions:
mission with the pre-processing layer and mission without any pre-processing,
and performance of both missions are compared.


\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

The results of the marker detector running through a camera log file with 32613
frames are here shown. It is important to remark that not all the frames
contained a visible marker. Figure \ref{fig:detection_rate} shows the detection
rate of the markers under different pre-processing algorithms and with
different image scales. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, trim={1.6cm 6.9cm 2.3cm 6.7cm}]{./fig/detection_rate.pdf}
    \caption{Relation between detection rate, pre-processing method and image size}
	\label{fig:detection_rate}
\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:detection_rate}, one can see that the frames without any
pre-processing increases the detection rate as long as the image size is bigger.
The normalized image, does not show significantly change when compared to the
baseline. This behavior is similar for all image resolutions.

On the other hand, it is possible to see on the graph that both Method 3 and
Method 4 overcome the firsts two. The Method 4 presents better performance
than the Method 3. Interestingly, both methods also did not show dependency to
the scales as strong as the Method 1 and 2. Both methods detects more than
20000 frames for all sizes, while the Methods 1 and 2 only achieved this at
full image. 

As already mentioned, the detection rate is not the only important factor since
visual servoing missions also are affected by the detection time. Thus, Figure
\ref{fig:processing_time} shows the required processing time for detection of
the studied methods.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, trim={1.6cm 6.9cm 2.3cm 6.7cm}]{./fig/detection_time.pdf}
    \caption{Relation between average processing time, pre-processing method and image size}
	\label{fig:processing_time}
\end{figure}

As expected, processing time increases with the image size.  Since the Method 1
does not have any pre-processing stage, it has the faster detection time. The
Method 2 is the second faster, followed by the Method 3 and Method 4,
respectively. 

In terms of detection rate, it is possible to see that Method 3 and Method 4
surmount the Methods 1 and 2.  A closer look on these methods give us Table
\ref{tab:meth_comp}, which compares relatively methods 3 and 4.

Images with small resolution affects the pose estimation accuracy. Thus, we
will take the bigger resolution in which we have a reasonable time for the
visual servoing task for comparison. On that case we decided to use the scale
factor of 0.4, which causes the image resolution to be 816x816 and feed the
visual controller at 6.25Hz.

At this scale factor, the Method 4 improves the detection rate of 6.45\% in
terms of detection rate, but it comes with the cost of an increase of 33.44\%
in the average detection time. Thus, we will prefer to use Method 3 instead of
Method 4.

\subsection{Visual servoing performance}

The vehicle was moved to the front of the marker and waited for a stable
detection before starts the visual servoing task.  However, due to the poor
visibility on the day, the Apriltags marker was not able to detect any marker,
which invalidated the visual servoing without any pre-processing.  After enable
applying Method 3, the marker detection started and allowed a visual servoing
mission.  The results of the visual servoing are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:vs_surge} to \ref{fig:vs_yaw}.

This clearly show the improvement caused by the treatment of the image before
running the visual servoing mission. In that case, specifically, the visual
servoing was not be possible by using only the grayscale image. So it improved
from a state of no-operation to a regular mission.

Lately, the methods was once again applied to a log data. The results are shown
in Figures \ref{fig:detection_rate2} and \ref{fig:detection_time2}. It shows
the inability of the marker detector to detect markers under Method 1 and
Method 2. On the other hand, Methods 3 and 4 were able to detect most of the
8956 frames contained in the log file.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:concl}

On this paper we briefly presented the concepts and challenges of underwater
image formation. It also was presented three methods to improve the underwater
image aiming to increase the detection rate of artificial fiducial markers.
Since the purpose of the detection is to feed a visual controller for visual
servoing task, the time for detection is also observed.

The results showed that simply applying a local contrast enhancement on the
image increases significantly the detection rate. A method based on Iqbal's
paper is also applied. Although the Iqbal's based-method increases the
detection rate, the processing time increases in a higher proportion, which
caused its use not be the preferable for the visual servoing, when compared to
Method 3.

We also have seen that, due to the underwater image quality, the marker
detector was not able to feed the visual controller using raw image. On the
other hand, using Method 3, the marker detector found several images and
performed visual servoing normally. This result shows the proposed methods not
only increases the visual controller frequency, by the improvement of the
detection rate, but also makes the visual servoing possible when the image
quality is not favorable.
